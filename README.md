# 🌟 Frontend Mentor - Four Card Feature Section 🌟

Hello! 👋

This is my solution for the **"Four Card Feature Section"** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I'm a beginner developer, and I'm excited to share what I've created! 🚀

## 📑 Project Description

The project showcases a four-card feature section, built using HTML and Sass (SCSS). This challenge was a great opportunity to practice and implement various CSS techniques, such as Flexbox and Grid.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** - for the structure of the page.
- **Sass (SCSS)** - for styling, with a modular approach dividing styles into components and layout.
- **CSS Grid** - used to create the main layout of the page.
- **Flexbox** - used for arranging elements within the cards.
- **Rem** - used instead of px as the unit of measurement, which I found really helpful for managing responsiveness.

## 📂 File Structure

The project is organized to keep the code clean and modular.

## ⏱️ Time Taken

The entire project took me about **2 hours** to complete. I'm not sure if this is fast or slow for a beginner, but I'm quite happy with what I've achieved. 😊

## 💭 Reflections

During this project, I learned:

- How to split styles into separate files for better code organization.
- How to effectively use CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- The advantages of using `rem` units over `px`.

I'm really proud of the result, and I hope my future projects will be even better! 💪
